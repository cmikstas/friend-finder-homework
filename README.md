**What does this project do?**

This project uses Node.js, Express, Javascript, and Heroku to do the following:

* Serve up a fully functional website on Heroku at the URL: `https://damp-caverns-57139.herokuapp.com/`

* Users are able to complete a survey where personality trait questions are asked and, once `Submit` is selected, they are pushed into an array of objects which contains the user name, user photograph, and all the user scores.

* Once `Submit` is selected, the user entry will then be compared against all the other scores from the other users with information in the array. The object with the most similar score will be returned in a modal and will show the user name and photo of that other user.

**Why is this project useful?**

* This project has taught me how to use Express to create html routes which allow a functional website to be served up on Heroku.

* I have also used Express to create API routing with `Get` and `Post` routes that allow information to be passed into and out of the server.

* This project is also deployed on Heroku.

**How can users get started with this project?**

* The user can go to `https://damp-caverns-57139.herokuapp.com/` and select the `Go to Survey` option.

* Once the user fills out the survey questions and hits `Submit`, the closest match will be displayed.
